# discord-bot
A simple bot to manage our SERL discord server


# Development
The bot is based on the official [resource from Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started) to get started building Discord apps. Then we will experiment on how to host the bot in an efficent manner. Afterwards we will add functionality to the bot to make it usable.
